## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Regulatory & Compliance 🔴 HIGH
**Description:** Government policies, state electricity board approval, charging standards

**Likelihood:** 70% probability

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-engage with state electricity boards (6 months before launch)
- Join industry associations (SIAM, ISGF) for policy advocacy
- Allocate ₹5Cr legal & compliance budget
- Diversify geographically (reduce dependency on single state)

### Risk 2: Land Acquisition 🟡 MEDIUM
**Description:** Getting prime locations for highway/urban stations

**Likelihood:** 50% probability

**Mitigation:**
- Lease model (vs. buy) reduces CapEx 30%
- Partner with property developers & mall operators
- Pre-identify 200+ backup locations
- Negotiate early for long-term leases (10-15 years)

### Risk 3: Competition 🔴 HIGH
**Description:** Larger competitors (Charge Zone, Tata Power) entering Phase 1 cities

**Likelihood:** 80% probability

**Mitigation:**
- First-mover advantage in highways (underserved segment)
- Build brand loyalty through superior technology
- Secure OEM partnerships (exclude competitors)
- Consider strategic M&A if funding available

### Risk 4: Technology Obsolescence 🟢 LOW
**Description:** Charging standards (V2G) or technology evolution

**Likelihood:** 20% probability

**Mitigation:**
- Use modular hardware design (easy upgrades)
- Stay on latest industry standards (IEC 62196)
- Allocate 5% revenue for R&D
- Partner with technology leaders

### Risk 5: Demand Uncertainty 🟡 MEDIUM
**Description:** EV adoption slower than projected

**Likelihood:** 30% probability

**Mitigation:**
- Diversify to other energy services (solar, batteries)
- Build flexible station designs (hybrid use)
- Tie pricing to actual EV volumes (variable cost model)
- Focus on government fleet vehicles (SCCL, postal services)
